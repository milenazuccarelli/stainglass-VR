# stainglass-VR
WebVR proof of concept using previous living walls project (motion stained glass) superimposed on photosphere.

## Implementation
 Used WebVR and WebGL API to implement a single page HTML VR with using a church photosohere with a previous projection mapping project (of motion stained glass windows) as a starting point. 
 A simple node.js server with express was used to render the HTML. 
 
 Added sound clips for each window (still a work in progress) initiated by clicking on image - this will be be resolved with VR input onEnter and onExit events.
